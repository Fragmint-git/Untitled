# Mobile Platform Strategy

This directory will contain the configuration and integration for deploying the VR Tournament application to mobile platforms (iOS and Android).

## Strategy

For mobile deployment, we will use a hybrid approach:

1. **Shared Codebase**: Maximize code reuse between desktop and mobile platforms.
2. **Capacitor/Cordova Integration**: Use Capacitor or Cordova to wrap the web application for iOS and Android.
3. **Platform-Specific Features**: Implement platform-specific features as needed.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Mobile-Ready Web Application

- Ensure the web UI is responsive and works well on mobile devices
- Create a separate mobile-specific CSS
- Implement touch-friendly UI components

### Phase 2: Capacitor Integration

- Add Capacitor to the project
- Configure Capacitor for both iOS and Android
- Implement native features (camera, push notifications, etc.)

### Phase 3: Platform-Specific Optimizations

- iOS-specific optimizations
- Android-specific optimizations
- App store deployment preparations

## Required Dependencies

These will be added when mobile development begins:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@capacitor/android": "^5.0.0",
    "@capacitor/core": "^5.0.0",
    "@capacitor/ios": "^5.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@capacitor/cli": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```
